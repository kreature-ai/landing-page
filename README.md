# landing-page
This is the landing page project from The Odin Project. This may be updated on a later date to add more functionality (JS, more styling, etc.).


EDIT: This was pretty difficult for me, especially since I just lost my dog. It was fun though (much better than the flex modal exercise). All that to say that the code and my workflow was TERRIBLE. I'm sure there was a better way to get to my imperfect solution, but I'm just happy that it is finished. I will definitely revisit this in a week or so to spruce it up. :-)
